Antiques are the ancestors of the makeMyStuff which combine the two functions into one. The main program is traceThroughAudio and is the master program. The program takes forever to render so its recommended that you save the movie and audio files variables from the workspace after you're done so you don't lose them! This will take up toooons of space though so be aware.
